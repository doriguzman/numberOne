        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria Ã— ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria,
        collectively known as the strawberries. It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated
        for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities,
        either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial
        strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume,
        and many others.

        The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France during the late 18th century.[3] Prior to this, wild strawberries
        and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit. The strawberry fruit
        was mentioned in ancient Roman literature in reference to its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry
        from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. Charles V, France's king from 1364 to 1380, had
        1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the wild
        strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in
        English miniatures.[citation needed] The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses. By the 16th
        century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for its supposed medicinal
        properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for regular strawberry farming
        had increased by the mid-16th century. The combination of strawberries and cream was created by Thomas Wolsey in
        the court of King Henry VIII.[5] Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578.
        By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: F. vesca, F. moschata, and F. viridis. The
        garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated asexually by cutting
        off the runners.

        Two subspecies of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens.
        The introduction of F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of
        history because this species gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent
        and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to
        Chile in 1712, it introduced the strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that
        we have today. The Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when
        the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the
        Chilean strawberry.

        At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit. It was discovered
        in 1766 that the female plants could only be pollinated by plants that produced large fruit: F. moschata, F. virginiana,
        and F. ananassa. This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only
        flowers. As more large-fruit producing plants were cultivated the Chilean strawberry slowly decreased in population
        in Europe, except for around Brest where the Chilean strawberry thrived. The decline of the Chilean strawberry was
        caused by F. ananassa.[6]
