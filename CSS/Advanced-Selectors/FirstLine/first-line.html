        <h1>About the Giant Panda</h1>
        <p>
                The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and
                relieves itself dozens of times a day. It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary
                needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather like thumbs. Pandas
                will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

        <p>
                Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as
                pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season. Pandas
                are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They
                may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.
