    <h1> Everything You Need to Know About Allergy Shots</h1>

    <p>If you suffer from debilitating allergies, chances are, you’ve heard about allergy shots (aka immunotherapy) as a potential treatment. But what are allergy shots, how do they work, and are they worth it? Here’s everything you need to know.</p>
   <h2>First, let's do a quick primer on allergies in general.</h2> 
    <p>“An allergy is an abnormal response the body makes to something that is normal in nature,” Stanley Fineman, M.D., former president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and current practitioner at Atlanta Allergy and Asthma, tells SELF. “The body becomes sensitized to a protein that most people are not sensitized to, which releases chemical mediators that cause symptoms.”
    Inhalant allergens like grass, pollen, weeds, dust mites, and pet dander can cause nasal symptoms like an itchy or runny nose, or lung-based symptoms like asthma and wheezing. Food allergies work the same way. If you’re allergic to something like peanuts, your body recognizes peanut proteins as an allergen and produces Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. According to the Mayo Clinic, food allergy symptoms can include vomiting or diarrhea, hives, shortness of breath, throat tightening, and life-threatening anaphylaxis.
    The first step to treating your allergies is figuring out exactly what's causing them, so Dr. Fineman suggests visiting a board-certified allergist who will conduct tests (either a skin panel, blood work, or both) to confirm the presence of allergies. From there, the physician will work with a patient on the best course of treatment. And, for some, that course may be allergy shots.</p>
<h2> Basically, allergy shots are a form of desensitization therapy for your body. </h2>

<p>A medical provider injects the patient with small doses of the allergen that increase over time, which helps their body get used to the allergen so that it stops reacting to it. But they're currently only available to fight inhalant allergies, not food allergies.
Here’s how the whole thing works, according to the ACAAI: Your doctor will isolate the proteins of allergens you are allergic to, and regularly inject you with small amounts of these proteins. For the first several (usually nine or more) months of treatment, you undergo one or two injections per week that gradually increase in dosage. Eventually you reach a “maintenance” phase where you are tolerant to a high dose of the allergen, at which point you can scale back the shots to every four or six weeks.
